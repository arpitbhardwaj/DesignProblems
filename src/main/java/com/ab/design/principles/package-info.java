 * SOLID is an acronym that stands for five key design principles:
 *      single responsibility principle
 *      open-closed principle
 *      Liskov substitution principle
 *      interface segregation principle
 *      dependency inversion principle
 *
 * Other Principles
 *      Favoring Composition Over Inheritance
 *          The fact that Java does not support multiple inheritances is one reason for favoring composition over inheritance in Java
 *          Composition offers better test-ability of a class than Inheritance.
 *          Although both Composition and Inheritance allow you to reuse code, one of Inheritanceâ€™s disadvantages is that it breaks encapsulation.
 *          Another reason why composition is preferred over inheritance is flexibility.
 *      Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle
 *      Keep It Simple and Stupid (KISS) Principle
