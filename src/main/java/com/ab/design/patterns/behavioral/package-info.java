 *
 * Template Method	used to create a template method stub and defer some of the steps of implementation to the subclasses.
 * Mediator	        used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.
 * COR          	used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them.
 * Observer	        useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change.
 * Strategy	        is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.
 * Command	        is used to implement lose coupling in a request-response model.
 * State	        is used when an Object change it’s behavior based on it’s internal state.
 * Visitor	        is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects.
 * Interpreter	    defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
 * Iterator	        used to provide a standard way to traverse through a group of Objects.
 * Memento          is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we can restore later on.
