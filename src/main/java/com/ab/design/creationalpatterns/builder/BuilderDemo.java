 * @author Arpit Bhardwaj
 * Builder pattern helps us in creating immutable classes with large set of state attributes.
 *
 * difference between builder and abstract factory pattern is that,
 * builder provides you more control over the object creation process and thatâ€™s it.
 *
 * StringBuilder and Build Pattern are not same, instead the String Builder append method uses kinde of builder functionality implicitlt
 * StringBuilder class can be used when you want to modify a string without creating a new object.
 * Hence Stringbuilder instance are immutable
