 *      An architecture built around microservices

 * Serverless
 *      is an arrangement where the enterprise hosts its software on a third-party FaaS (Function as a service) platform such as AWS Lambda
 *      here key is the software(function) is deployed with trigger condition, and when it met only then function runs on server.
 *      servers do exist in a serverless implementation. It’s just that the enterprise itself doesn’t own or run the servers themselves
 *      For ex. status update notification to friends
 *          when a person updates the status(trigger condition) the it run a function on AWS lambda to send notication to friend list.
